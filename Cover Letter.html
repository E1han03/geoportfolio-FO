											<p>I have a willingness to increase my skill base in surveying which will motivate me to work harder and present myself as a good fit for the company. I am currently completing my final year of the Bachelor of Applied Science (Land Surveying) at RMIT university having started back in 2018 from the Diploma of Surveying.</p>

										
											<p>Having gained experience from a variety of surveying firms such as at Calibre group, MNG Land Surveyors and Heading & Associates, I have had the opportunity to be exposed to both construction surveying doing large greenfield developments with Calibre Group and MNG as well as the privilege of experiencing Cadastral Surveying with Heading & Associates at residential areas.</p>

											<p>This experience has provided me with the knowledge of operating many surveying equipment such as the Trimble S6 total station, Trimble R2 GPS, Leica TS15 & TS16 Total Station and the Leica GS16 & GS18 GPS. Along with that, my course at RMIT has provided students with further operational procedures for the Leica instruments.</p>
										<p>My coursework has introduced me to many programs such as AutoCAD, LisCAD, ArcMap, Microsoft Excel, Trimble Realworks, Trimble Business Center, FME and many more.</p>
										<p>My availability suits the job description very well as I am also seeking a casual role working around my studies. I am familiar with the work JREdwards provides as my most recent experience in the industry was with Heading & Associates completing title and feature surveys in Metro Melbourne and surrounding areas.</p>
										<p>The high level of practicality I have experienced from my coursework and the amount of experience I have been privileged to gain in the industry will decrease the required training time if not completely wipe it out meaning I will be well prepared to assist with fieldwork and work as soon as possible.</p>
										<p>The location of the office being close to the Northern suburbs will assure punctuality as I live in Mickleham and do hold a full valid Victorian driverâ€™s license along with owning a vehicle. I also attain a white card for your peace of mind which is a necessity for all construction work.</p>
										
										<p>I look forward to hearing from you at your convenience. Feel free to ask me any questions. </p>
										<p>Regards,
Fatih Ozdemir
